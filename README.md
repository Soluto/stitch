Stitch is a suite of GraphQL tools to make it easier to serve data through GraphQL for existing data sources.

## Gateway - Data Plane

A simple no-code way to create a graphql API for an existing data source (REST, Mongo, SQL, etc) to graphql. Your data model is described using a standard schema, with some extra magic stitch directives added, and you have your data source served through graphql.

## Registry - Control Plane

The registry is our attempt at solving the issue of collaborating on a single graph in a large organization. Independent teams can author their own schemas representing their own data sources, and the end result is one big collaborative graph for all of the organization's data.

## Development

### Running locally

Use the Tiltfile/docker-compose.yml located in `deployment/dev` to get a local env running quickly

### CI & Versioning

- Tests run on all pull requests
- When pushing a new version tag to the repo, CI will pick it up and create a docker image from the tagged commit tagged as the git tag. I.E. pushing v0.7.0 tag will create `ghcr.io/soluto/stitch:0.7.0` image and also `ghrc.io/soluto/stitch:latest`.
